Q1. How does CI(Jenkins) help DevOps practices?
CI/Jenkins helps DevOps practices by enabling rapid testing/building of code commited to a git repository. Using Jenkins, developers can commit code to a repository, which 
through automation, immediately triggers a test and build of the committed code. This allows developers to submit smaller blocks of code and receive rapid feedback. Additionally,
it allows on their code to be integrated with the most up-to-date codebase submitted by other developers, allowing for the rapid identification of potential compatability issues.
Using CI, automation can be built into the development process, saving time and reducing the amount of time required to package/deploy software. Through automation, after each commit, 
the code can be merged and tested, and even deployed to a test/production environment without any human intervention. This rapid/continuous integration/deployment enables a shift left
for developers and operations and saves countless hours of time in the development/deployment process.

Q2. What are the alternate ways for Jenkins plugins?
